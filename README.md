# fake-grocery-data

This is some notional data I use in Foundry tutorials.

It's very simple data from a fictional set of grocery stores in the US. Since these are raw datasets intended to let me show some data cleaning procedures, they're intentionally messy in some respects. 

The datasets include:
- *Transactions* - A customer makes a transaction when they buy groceries
- *Baskets* - Baskets represents which items and how many of each were bought in a single transaction
- *Customers* - Each row is information about a single customer
- *Products* - Descriptins about the different products customers can buy, including product name, brand, store department, etc.
- *Stores* - The store that the parent company owns

The products dataset is based on [this one on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/product-prices-and-sizes-from-walmart-grocery) by "The Devastator". I replaced all real brands and product names with fake ones.
